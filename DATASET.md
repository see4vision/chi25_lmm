To the left of the tree, there is a green illuminated structure that looks like a stylized tree made of light tubes. There are also other trees wrapped with colorful string lights in the background. Buildings with lit windows can be seen, and the sky is dark, indicating it's nighttime. There's a tower in the distance with red and blue lights at the top. People are walking around the area, enjoying the festive atmosphere. The ground appears to be wet, possibly from recent rain. | N/A | 2023-12 | 2024-04-15 | Available upon request |

To retrieve the asked timeslots I need to interprete the graphic of the app. This is not 100% perfect but I will try to help you.<br><br>Your bloodsugar level 3 hours ago was about 230 mg/dl. This is much higher than the normal value.<br><br>Your bloodsugar level 2 hours ago was about 210 mg/dl and this is still too high than the normal level.<br><br>Your bloodsugar level 1 hour ago was about 190 mg/dl. This is a bit lower then previous value but still higher then the normal level.<br><br>Like you can see is your bloodsugar level the last few hours lower but not low enough to be in range with the normal value. I want to ask you to contact your nurse or doctor for advice about how you can lower your bloodsugar and keep it under control. It's very important to check at regular base the bloodsugar level and to keep following your diet and keep to do some sports. I hope I was able to help you!" | N/A | 2023-10 | 2024-04-15 | Available upon request |
